1 distance to merchant and overall

Not get over all distance - It is a great indicator on whether we want to accept an offer or not 

So say that is six dollars right so kind of the average here in the phoenix market  .... that is ok if its fast ...


- merchant - need to be fast - consistent ,accurate ??? 

- Item count  -  Higher Bill total is ideal 

- Fast food - Place order - Quick spots ,Higher del.pay .    - Be selective  

- scheduled - You can't get very dasily you have to go scheduled  you go to change door dash ...

- Buzy -  delivery Pause & End   


 Don't pigeon holed into like you just have one choice right
